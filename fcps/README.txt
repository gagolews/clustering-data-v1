Datasets from the *Fundamental Clustering Problem Suite*
proposed by A. Ultsch from the Marburg University, Germany.

Source: Ultsch A., Clustering with SOM: U*C,
In Proc. Workshop on Self-Organizing Maps, Paris, France, 2005, 75-82.

Each dataset consists of 212–4096 observations in 2–3 dimensions.
The `GolfBall` dataset is not included as it has no cluster structure.
`Tetragonula` and `Leukemia` are also not part of our suite
as they are given as distance matrices.

The datasets were originally published elsewhere, but now can be accessed,
e.g., from the R package FCPS <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FCPS>;
