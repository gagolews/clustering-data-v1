An excellent battery of 20 diverse datasets created or compiled
by P. Fränti and his colleagues and research students
from the University of Eastern Finland.

We have not included the `G2` sets as we suggest
the cluster variances should be corrected for space dimensionality;
see the `g2mg` battery for an alternative.
`Birch3` is not included as no ground-truth labels were provided.
We excluded the `DIM`-sets as they are too easy for most algorithms.
