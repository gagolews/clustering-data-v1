This battery features two large, high-dimensional datasets:

1. [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) –
    a database of handwritten digits (a preprocessed remix of
    [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-special-database-19) data
    made by Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C.J.C. Burges),

2. [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) –
    a similarly-structured dataset of Zalando articles
    compiled by H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf.

Both datasets consist of 70,000 flattened 28x28 grayscale images
(train and test samples combined).
