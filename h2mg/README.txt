Two Gaussian-like hubs of equal sizes,
with spread dependent on datasets' dimensionalities.
Each dataset consists of 2,048 observations in 1, 2, ..., 128 dimensions.
Each point is sampled from a sphere centred at its own cluster's centre,
of radius that follows the Gaussian distribution
with a predefined scaling parameter.

Just like in the case of the `g2mg` battery, we suggest
these datasets should be studied separately from other batteries.
